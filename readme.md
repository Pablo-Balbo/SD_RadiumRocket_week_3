# Software Developer - week 3

**Version 3.0.0**

This is the report from the Radium Rocket Software Developer course corresponding to week 3.  
During this week, in the Radium Rocket Software Developer course, we were asked to create a journal cover.  
The page had to be constituted following this layout as a guide:

https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp

The main tool when styling the page should be Flexbox applied to the css files.  
Finally, in response to the weekly problem proposed by Radium Rocket, the objective was to deliver a link that leads directly to the front page in its web version, whether for mobile version, tablet version or desktop version.  

## Software Developer - weeks 5 & 6

During weeks 5 and 6 of the Radium Rocket Software Developer course we created a subscription page, to which we added the necessary logic to make HTTP calls to a server provided by the tutor.  
For this, we resort to the use of fetch, and in this way we begin to understand promises and calback.  
In addition, the function of saving data in LocalStorage has been added. To view them, you must access the page inspector, to the section "Storage -> LocalStorage".
